### **Work (links)- Bunch of tasks, I was doing there, are following : -** 

**1) PPT on "Predictive Analytics on Used cases in Different Industries" (Real Life based) : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PvJIRo9rA1tnF4Q-U_J2M_XZI9WPWMQPBDjolz1b7Uk/edit?usp=sharing**

**2) Predictive Analytics on "Predicting Employees Absenteeism" (Colab link) : Dataset - Records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil : -** 

* **Data Source : - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work .**

* ***Here is glimpse of the solution file : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eLDtDbFKbhU5TP4MlRrEkwPMzNt0u1iQ?usp=sharing***

**3) Predictive Analytics on "Customer Lifetime Value of Retail sector" (colab link) :** 

* **Problem Statement : - An UK based retail company was curious to know about their customers, so that they can change their business strategies form which they can acquire more customers or to help their customers for retention, also few additional things wants to know that what's the customer worth in terms of Customer Lifetime Value wise, also some insights to know about UK based customers and Non-UK based customers. So that we can decide our approach for prediction wise.**

## **Formulas :**

* ***CLTV = ((Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency)/Churn Rate) x Profit margin***

* ***Customer Value = Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency***

* ***Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Number of Orders***

* ***Purchase Frequency = Total Number of Orders / Total Number of Customers***

* ***Customer Lifetime=1/Churn Rate***

* ***Churn Rate= 1-Repeat Rate***



**Linear Regression R squared: 89.13% (My approach for the modeling was to include all countries CustomerID, although UK have the dominating data but I choose to predict on overall basis)**
